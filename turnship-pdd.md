---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the development plan for Turnship, a focused networking automation tool for a small group of college students (~50 users) at a single location/university. The approach emphasizes:
- Rapid development using AI tools
- Simple, maintainable architecture
- Direct user feedback loops
- Cost-effective infrastructure

## 2. Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Small Scale, High Impact**: Build specifically for your user group's needs
- **Direct Feedback**: With 50 users, you can talk to everyone personally
- **Simplicity Over Scale**: Choose simple solutions that work well for dozens, not thousands
- **Cost-Conscious**: Keep running costs minimal

### Development Approach
- Solo developer with AI assistance
- Weekly user feedback sessions
- Feature decisions based on actual user requests

## 3. Technical Architecture

### Simplified Stack for Small-Scale Deployment

#### Frontend
- **Primary**: React Web App (skip mobile initially)
- **Why**: 50 college students all have laptops; mobile can come later if needed
- **Hosting**: Replit (free tier sufficient)

#### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL on Replit for production
- **Why**: SQLite is perfect for 50 users; Replit's Postgres is free and sufficient

#### Third-Party Integrations (Simplified)
- **Gmail API**: Read/send emails (stay within free quota)
- **OpenAI API**: For email generation (pay-per-use, ~$20/month for 50 users)
- **Skip Initially**: LinkedIn API (complex approval), Handshake API (may not be needed)

#### Infrastructure
- **Everything on Replit**: Development, staging, and production
- **Cost**: ~$7/month for Replit Hacker plan (if needed)
- **No need for**: Load balancers, CDNs, complex monitoring

## 4. Development Tools & Workflow

### Primary Development Environment
- **Cursor**: Main IDE for AI-assisted coding
  - Custom prompts for Turnship-specific patterns
  - Component generation templates
  - API integration helpers

### AI Development Assistants
- **Claude Code CLI**: For complex feature implementation
  - API endpoint generation
  - Database schema design
  - Testing suite creation
  
### Version Control & Collaboration
- **GitHub**: Repository management
  - Feature branch workflow
  - PR-based development
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### Rapid Prototyping
- **Replit**: Initial development and testing
  - Quick deployment for user testing
  - Database hosting during development
  - API endpoint testing

## 5. Development Phases

### Condensed 8-Week Development Plan

#### Phase 1: Core MVP (Weeks 1-3)
**Goal**: Get a working app that sends emails and tracks responses

- **Week 1**: Authentication + Gmail Integration
  - Google OAuth login
  - Gmail API connection
  - Basic database schema
  
- **Week 2**: Email Generation + Sending
  - OpenAI integration for email generation
  - Email preview and editing
  - Send from user's Gmail
  
- **Week 3**: Connection Tracking
  - Simple dashboard showing all contacts
  - Manual status updates
  - Basic email history

**Deliverable**: Working app your 50 users can start testing

#### Phase 2: Smart Features (Weeks 4-5)
**Goal**: Add the intelligence that makes it valuable

- Email monitoring for responses
- Auto-status suggestions
- Follow-up reminders
- Template library

**Deliverable**: App that actually saves time

#### Phase 3: Polish & User Requests (Weeks 6-8)
**Goal**: Refine based on direct user feedback

- UI improvements based on user feedback
- Most requested features from your 50 users
- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Simple analytics (response rates, etc.)

**Deliverable**: Polished app ready for your user base

### What We're Intentionally Skipping
- Mobile app (not needed for 50 laptop users)
- Complex integrations (LinkedIn, Handshake)
- Advanced analytics (overkill for small scale)
- Automated sending (manual approval is fine for 50 users)

## 6. Implementation Strategy

### 6.1 Small-Scale, High-Touch Development Approach

#### **"Local-First, Deploy-When-Ready" Strategy**

Start with local development for maximum speed, then deploy to Replit when you have something worth showing to users.

### 6.2 Simplified Implementation Plan

#### **Week 1: Local Foundation Sprint**
**Tools**: Claude Code CLI + VS Code/Cursor (local)

```
Day 1-2: Local project setup
- Initialize Node.js/Express project
- Set up SQLite for local development
- Implement Google OAuth (use ngrok for callback URL)

Day 3-4: Gmail API integration
- Read emails functionality
- Send emails from user's account
- Store email history locally

Day 5-7: Basic UI
- Simple React frontend
- Email composer
- Connection list view
```

**Key Decision**: Stay local until core features work perfectly.

#### **Week 2: Make It Useful**
**Tools**: Cursor + OpenAI API (still local)

```
Monday-Tuesday: Email generation with AI
Wednesday: Improve UI/UX based on your own testing
Thursday: Prep for deployment (PostgreSQL migration script)
Friday: Deploy to Replit and get 5 friends testing
```

**First Deploy**: End of Week 2 when you have a working product

#### **Week 3: Real User Onboarding**
**Now on Replit for easy access**

- Fix issues found by first 5 testers
- Simple dashboard with Tailwind CSS
- Manual status updates
- CSV export
- Onboard all 50 users by end of week

**Get all 50 users onboarded by end of week 3**

#### **Week 4-5: The Features They Actually Want**

Based on user feedback, implement the top 3 requested features. Likely candidates:
- Email templates they can share
- Follow-up reminders
- Basic response detection
- Bulk email operations

#### **Week 6-8: Polish and Sustain**

- Fix bugs reported by users
- Improve UI based on usage patterns
- Add simple analytics dashboard
- Set up backup and maintenance procedures

### 6.3 Local Development Setup

#### **Initial Local Stack**
```bash
# Project structure
turnship/
â”œâ”€â”€ server/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ db/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ public/
â””â”€â”€ shared/
    â””â”€â”€ types/
```

#### **Local Development Tools**
- **Database**: SQLite (migrate to PostgreSQL before deploying)
- **OAuth Testing**: ngrok for stable callback URLs
- **Email Testing**: Use your personal Gmail for development
- **Frontend Dev**: Vite for fast hot-reload

#### **Week 1 Local Setup Commands**
```bash
# Initialize project
mkdir turnship && cd turnship
npm init -y

# Backend dependencies
npm install express sqlite3 googleapis express-session
npm install -D nodemon

# Frontend setup (in client folder)
npm create vite@latest client -- --template react
cd client && npm install
npm install tailwindcss axios

# Development servers
# Terminal 1: npm run server (backend on :5000)
# Terminal 2: npm run dev (frontend on :3000)
```

### 6.4 Transition to Production

#### **Week 2: Migration Checklist**
- [ ] Convert SQLite schema to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Update database connection code
- [ ] Test all features locally with PostgreSQL
- [ ] Create Replit project
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Configure custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Deploy and test with 5 users

#### **Why This Timing Works**
1. **Week 1**: You need speed, not deployment
2. **Week 2**: You have something worth showing
3. **Week 3**: Users need easy access
4. **Week 4+**: Deployment is stable, focus on features

### 6.5 Development Workflow

#### **Weeks 1-2: Local Development**
```
Morning: Write features in VS Code/Cursor
Afternoon: Test everything locally
Evening: Prepare for next day
No deployment complexity to slow you down!
```

#### **Weeks 3-8: Production Development**
```
Morning: Code new features locally
Afternoon: Push to GitHub â†’ Auto-deploy to Replit
Evening: Get user feedback, plan next day
```

### 6.6 Local Development Best Practices

1. **Use Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # .env.local
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=xxx
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx
   OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./dev.db
   ```

2. **ngrok for OAuth**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 3
   ngrok http 5000
   # Use the https URL for Google OAuth redirect
   ```

3. **Test Data Generator**
   ```javascript
   // Create 20 sample connections for UI testing
   npm run seed-db
   ```

4. **Git Ignore Local Files**
   ```
   dev.db
   .env.local
   node_modules/
   ```

- React Native only if PWA insufficient

**If growth exceeds 50 users:**
- Implement waitlist
- Plan infrastructure upgrade
- Consider pricing model

### Success Indicators
- 40+ active users (80% adoption)
- Users sending 10+ emails/week through platform
- 50% reduction in time spent on networking
- Direct job/internship offers attributed to tool
