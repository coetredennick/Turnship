## Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Status System Validation Bug
**Issue:** Connection status showed old compound labeling ("First Impression (draft)"), lost color/stage indicators after clicks, manual changes failed with "Validation failed" 400 errors.

**Root Cause:** Database contained old compound statuses but frontend sent clean statuses, causing validation mismatch.

**Solution:**
- Created migration script `server/migrate-status-system.js`
- Migrated 2 connections from compound to clean format
- Updated validation logic to accept clean status format
- Restarted server with fixed validation

**Files Modified:** `server/db/connection.js`, `server/routes/connections.js`

**Impact:** ✅ Status system fully functional with proper validation

### 2. Delete Draft Bug
**Issue:** 400 Bad Request errors when attempting to delete drafts.

**Root Cause:** Backend validation rejected empty strings, but frontend tried deleting via `emailsAPI.saveDraft(connectionId, '')`.

**Solution:**
- Updated validation in `server/routes/emails.js` line 273 to allow empty strings
- Modified database layer validation to accept empty draft content
- Ensured proper draft deletion workflow

**Files Modified:** `server/routes/emails.js`, `server/db/connection.js`

**Impact:** ✅ Draft deletion works without errors

### 3. Draft Bank Cross-Contamination
**Issue:** Drafts appeared across all connections instead of being connection-specific.

**Root Cause:** Architectural misunderstanding - Draft Bank was implemented as global instead of connection-specific.

**Solution:**
- Added `draftBankConnection` state to Dashboard
- Updated eye icon click handler to pass specific connection
- Modified `DraftBankModal` to accept `targetConnection` prop and filter drafts accordingly
- Updated UI text to show "Drafts for [Connection Name]"
- Added connection-specific empty states

**Files Modified:** `client/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`, `client/src/components/EmailComposer.jsx`

**Impact:** ✅ Draft Bank properly isolated per connection

### 4. Status Badge Visual Bug
**Issue:** Colors disappeared when clicked for editing.

**Root Cause:** Edit mode select in `StatusBadge.jsx` line 49 lacked color styling from `getBadgeColor(status)` function.

**Solution:**
- Added proper color styling to edit mode select element
- Applied `getBadgeColor(status)` function to editing state
- Maintained visual consistency across all states

**Files Modified:** `client/src/components/StatusBadge.jsx`

**Impact:** ✅ Status badges maintain visual consistency

### 5. CORS Connection Issues
**Issue:** Frontend couldn't connect due to port mismatches.

**Root Cause:** CORS configuration didn't include development ports 5176, 5177.

**Solution:**
- Extended CORS configuration in `server/index.js`
- Added support for flexible frontend development ports
- Ensured cross-origin requests work reliably

**Files Modified:** `server/index.js`

**Impact:** ✅ CORS issues resolved for flexible development

### 6. Email Generation Status Bug
**Issue:** Route tried setting "First Impression (sent)" but validation expected clean statuses.

**Root Cause:** Email generation route created invalid compound statuses.

**Solution:**
- Changed email generation to use clean status "First Impression"
- Updated route in `server/routes/emails.js`
- Aligned with clean status system

**Files Modified:** `server/routes/emails.js`

**Impact:** ✅ Email generation works with proper status format

### 7. Email Sending Status Progression Bug
**Issue:** Email sending created invalid compound statuses like "First Impression (sent)".

**Root Cause:** Improper status advancement logic.

**Solution:**
- Implemented proper status progression (First Impression → Follow-up → Response)
- Fixed email sending route to advance status correctly
- Maintained clean status format throughout

**Files Modified:** `server/routes/emails.js`

**Impact:** ✅ Email sending advances status properly

### 8. Draft Status Color Bug
**Issue:** Draft status labels were hardcoded to blue instead of matching actual status colors.

**Root Cause:** Draft Bank modal used hardcoded `text-blue-600 bg-blue-100` instead of dynamic status colors.

**Solution:**
- Added `getDraftStatusBadgeColor()` function matching `StatusBadge` color system
- Updated draft status span to use dynamic colors based on status
- Applied proper color coding: First Impression (blue), Follow-up (orange), Response (purple), Meeting Scheduled (green), Not Contacted (gray)

**Files Modified:** `client/src/components/EmailComposer.jsx`

**Impact:** ✅ Draft labels match status color system with visual consistency

### 9. Progress Tracking Initialization Bug
**Issue:** Existing connections lacked progress tracking data.

**Root Cause:** New progress tracking columns needed baseline initialization.

**Solution:**
- Added migration logic to initialize `status_started_date` for existing connections
- Set baseline progress data for proper donut calculation
- Ensured backward compatibility

**Files Modified:** `server/db/connection.js`

**Impact:** ✅ Progress tracking works for all connections

## Major Feature Implementations

### 1. Progress Donut System
**Vision:** Standardized donut indicator for all statuses showing user progress within each stage.

**Implementation:**
- **Database Schema:** Added `status_started_date` and `composer_opened_date` columns
- **Backend Logic:** 
  - `updateConnectionEmailStatus()` resets progress when status changes
  - `trackComposerOpened()` function and API endpoint `/api/connections/:id/composer-opened`
  - Status updates set baseline dates for progress calculation
- **Frontend Components:**
  - Created `ProgressDonut.jsx` with SVG donut chart, status-colored progress, smooth animations
  - Integrated with `StatusBadge.jsx` showing donut next to status badges
  - Updated `EmailComposer.jsx` to track when user opens composer
- **Progress Logic:** 
  - 0% empty circle (no activity)
  - 33% when user opens email composer
  - 66% when draft created
  - 100% full + checkmark when email sent
  - Reset on status change
  - Colors match status colors

**Files Modified:** `server/db/connection.js`, `server/routes/connections.js`, `client/src/components/StatusBadge.jsx`, `client/src/components/EmailComposer.jsx`, `client/src/services/api.js`

**Files Created:** `client/src/components/ProgressDonut.jsx`

**Impact:** ✅ Comprehensive progress tracking with visual indicators

### 2. Status-Labeled Drafts System
**Vision:** Each draft labeled with the status it was written in for better organization.

**Implementation:**
- **Database Enhancement:** Added `draft_status` column to track which status each draft belongs to
- **Backend Logic:**
  - Modified `saveEmailDraft()` to accept and store draft status
  - Auto-detects current connection status if not provided
  - Clears draft_status when draft is deleted (empty content)
  - Updated allowed fields and API endpoints
- **Frontend Integration:**
  - Updated Draft Bank UI to show status labels as colored badges
  - Modified EmailComposer and EmailGenerationModal to save status-labeled drafts
  - Added visual status badges showing "[Status] Draft"

**Files Modified:** `server/db/connection.js`, `server/routes/emails.js`, `client/src/components/EmailComposer.jsx`, `client/src/components/EmailGenerationModal.jsx`

**Impact:** ✅ Drafts properly labeled and organized by status

### 3. Connection-Specific Draft Bank
**Vision:** Draft Bank should show only drafts for the specific connection, not global drafts.

**Implementation:**
- **State Management:** Added `draftBankConnection` state to Dashboard
- **UI Updates:** Modified eye icon click handler to pass specific connection
- **Modal Enhancement:** Updated `DraftBankModal` to accept `targetConnection` prop and filter accordingly
- **User Experience:** Changed UI text to show "Drafts for [Connection Name]" with connection-specific empty states

**Files Modified:** `client/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`, `client/src/components/EmailComposer.jsx`

**Impact:** ✅ Draft Bank properly scoped to individual connections

## System Improvements

- **Schema Updates:** Added progress tracking columns (`status_started_date`, `composer_opened_date`, `draft_status`)
- **Migration Logic:** Proper handling of existing data with baseline initialization
- **Validation Improvements:** Fixed empty string handling and status format validation

### API Enhancements
- **New Endpoints:** `/api/connections/:id/composer-opened` for progress tracking
